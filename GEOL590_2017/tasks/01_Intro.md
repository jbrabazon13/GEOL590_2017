# Resources
* Jarrod Millman and Perez in Stodden, Leish and Peng (2015) on best practices for reproducible research, posted on Blackboard.
* Popular press news stories about an economics paper called "Growth in a time of debt" (American Economic Review, 2010). (This article)[http://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21576362-seminal-analysis-relationship-between-debt-and-growth-comes-under] from the Economist and (this one)[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-04-18/faq-reinhart-rogoff-and-the-excel-error-that-changed-history] from Bloomberg are a good place to start - I wouldn't read the original paper unless you're really into incorrect macroeconomics.
* The Excel spreadsheet `chon_rates.xlsx`, also posted on Blackboard.

# Tasks: complete by January 13 
* Make a 1-page or less bullet-pointed cheat sheet of best practices for reproducible data analysis.
* Write a paragraph describing the "Reinhart-Rogoff affair" and what it has to do with open science and reproducible data analysis. 
* For your edification (this is not really a task, I just want you to spend a few minutes staring into the abyss of real-world data practices): Spend a few minutes looking at the `chon_rates.xlsx` spreadsheet. This is a spreadsheet used to measure size distributions of polysaccharides, which have been determined by chromatography, and uses those size distributions to calculate the number of cuts that would be required to transition from one distribution to the other. Use the `Trace Precedents` and `Trace Dependents` functions to figure out what this spreadsheet is actually doing. You won't be able to figure it out, but using those two functions to do forensic analysis of Excel spreadsheets is a critical data analysis skill.
